# Simple Text Model
In this model, two algorthims have been applied: the Gibbs sampler for a Mixture of Multinomials and for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The data used to train the model is contained in in the Ô¨Åle kos_doc_data.mat. The word counts are in the matrix variables A and B for training and testing respectively, both matrices with 3 columns: document ID, word ID and word count. The words themselves are the variable V, such that eg. V(841) = 'bush'.
